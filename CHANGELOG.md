* Refactor label definitions to be more consistent by building labels and label selectors in partial helper templates. (#299) (by @cognifloyd)
* Use the correct `apiVersion` for `Ingress` to add support for Kubernetes `v1.22`. (#301) (by @arms11)
* Fix mounts for `jobs.preRegisterContentCommand` container to use the same mounts as the primary register-content container. (#322) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add support for providing custom st2actionrunner-specific docker repository, image name, pull policy, and pull secret via `values.yaml`. (#141) (by @Sheshagiri)
* Fix bug that hung an init container when `st2.packs.volumes.enabled` without `st2.packs.volumes.configs`. (#324) (by @rebrowning)
* Add ability to create custom labels for service account.(#327)(by @SuganJoe)
* Fix bug that would not set the appropriate redis connection string when using `redis.password` and `redis.usePassword` (#325) (by @rebrowning)
* New Feature: Add `existingConfigSecret`.  If this is defined, the `st2.secrets.conf` key within this secret will be written as /etc/st2/st2.secrets.conf and added to the end of the command line arguments of all pods. (#289) (by @eric-al/@ericreeves)
* New Feature: Add `extra_volumes` to all python-based st2 jobs. (#333) (by @bmarick)

## v0.100.0
* Switch st2 to `v3.7` as a new default stable version (#274)
* Upgrade MongoDB `v4.0` -> `v4.4` as 4.0 has reached its EOL. (#304)
* Migrate from `python 3.6` `Ubuntu Bionic` to `python 3.8` `Ubuntu Focal` as a base StackStorm OS (StackStorm/st2-dockerfiles#54)
* Add support for use of overrides that are available in `v3.7` of st2 via helm charts. (#306)

## v0.90.0
* Advanced Feature: Make securityContext (on Deployments/Jobs) and podSecurityContext (on Pods) configurable. This allows dropping all capabilities, for example. You can override the securityContext for `st2actionrunner`, `st2sensorcontainer`, and `st2client` if your actions or sensors need, for example, additional capabilites that the rest of StackStorm does not need. (#271) (by @cognifloyd)
* Prefix template helpers with chart name and format helper comments as template comments. (#272) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature: Add `extra_volumes` to all python-based st2 deployments. This can facilitate changing log levels by loading logging conf file(s) from a custom ConfigMap. (#276) (by @cognifloyd)
* Initialize basic unittest infrastructure using `helm-unittest`. Added tests for labels, custom annotations, SecurityContext, pullSecrets, pullPolicy, Resources, nodeSelector, tolerations, affinity, dnsPolicy, dnsConfig, ServiceAccount attach, postStartScript, both sensor-modes, env, envFrom, st2.packs.images, and st2.packs.volumes. (#284, #288, #292)
* Allow partitioning sensors using the hash_range strategy instead of one sensor per pod. (#218) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature to include possibility for external services in st2api, st2stream and st2auth, setting default value for this services as `ClusterIP` and `hostname: ""`. Also, added new entry for custom_annotations_test.yaml and created new unit test services_test.yaml. (by @sandesvitor)
* Advanced Feature: Add extra Helm hook Jobs. This minimizes the boilerplate required to run stackstorm workflows at various helm hook stages: post-install, pre-upgrade, post-upgrade. (#265) (by @cognifloyd)

## v0.80.0
* Switch st2 to `v3.6` as a new default stable version (#274)
* Explicitly differentiate sensor modes: `all-sensors-in-one-pod` vs `one-sensor-per-pod`. Exposes the mode in new `stackstorm/sensor-mode` annotation. (#222) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow adding custom env variables to any Deployment or Job. (#120) (by @AngryDeveloper)
* Template the contents of st2.config and the values in st2chatops.env. This allows adding secrets defined elsewhere in values. (#249) (by @cognifloyd)
* Set default/sample RBAC config files to "" (empty string) to prevent adding them. This is needed because they cannot be removed by overriding the roles/mappings values. (#247) (by @cognifloyd)
* Make configuring `stackstorm/sensor-mode=all-sensors-in-one-pod` more obvious by using `st2.packs.sensors` only for `one-sensor-per-pod`. `all-sensors-in-one-pod` mode now only uses values from `st2sensorcontainer`. (#246) (by @cognifloyd)
* Use "--convert" when loading keys into datastore (in key-load Job) so that `st2.keyvalue[].value` can be any basic JSON data type. (#253) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature: Add `extra_volumes` to `st2actionrunner`, `st2client`, `st2sensorcontainer`. This is useful for loading volumes to be used by actions or sensors. This might include secrets (like ssl certificates) and configuration (like system-wide ansible.cfg). (#254) (by @cognifloyd)
* Some `helm upgrades` do not need to run all the jobs. An upgrade that only touches RBAC config, for example, does not need to run the register-content job. Use `--set 'jobs.skip={apikey_load,key_load,register_content}'` to skip the other jobs. (#255) (by @cognifloyd)
* Refactor deployments/jobs to inject st2 username/password via `envFrom` instead of via `env`. (#257) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature: Add `envFromSecrets` to `st2actionrunner`, `st2client`, `st2sensorcontainer`, and jobs. This is useful for adding custom secrets to the environment. This complements the `extra_volumes` feature (loading secrets as files) to facilitate loading secrets that are not easily injected via the filesystem. (#259) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature to include `nodeSelector`, `affinity` and `tolerations` to `st2client`, allowing more flexibility to pod positioning. (#263) (by @sandesvitor)
* Template `~/.st2/config`. This allows customizing the settings used by the `st2client` and jobs pods for using the st2 apis. (#262) (by @cognifloyd)
* Fix indent for lifecycle postStart hook of `st2web` pod. (#268) (by @cognifloyd)
* Advanced Feature: Allow `st2web` to serve HTTPS when the ssl certs are provided via `st2web.extra_volumes`. To enable this, add `ST2WEB_HTTPS: "1"` to `st2web.env` in your values file. (#264) (by @cognifloyd)
* Custom annotations now apply to deployments and jobs, not just pods. (#270) (by @cognifloyd)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Auto-generate `datastore_crypto_key` on install if not provided. This way all HA installs will have a datastore_crypto_key configured. This is only a breaking change for installations that do not want a `datastore_crypto_key`. To disable set `datastore_crypto_key` to `disable` instead of setting it to `""`, `null`, or leaving it unset. (#266) (by @cognifloyd)

## v0.70.0
* New feature: Shared packs volumes `st2.packs.volumes`. Allow using cluster-specific persistent volumes to store packs, virtualenvs, and (optionally) configs. This enables using `st2 pack install`. It even works with `st2packs` images in `st2.packs.images`. (#199) (by @cognifloyd)
* Updated redis constant sentinel ID which will allow other sentinel peers to update to the new given IP in case of pod failure or worker node reboots. (#191) (by @manisha-tanwar)
* Removed reference to st2-license pullSecrets, which was missed when removing enterprise flags (#192) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add optional imagePullSecrets to ServiceAccount using `serviceAccount.pullSecret` from values.yaml. If pods do not have imagePullSecrets (eg without `image.pullSecret` in values.yaml), k8s populates them from the ServiceAccount. (#196 & #239) (by @cognifloyd)
* Reformat some yaml strings so that single quotes wrap strings that include double quotes (#194) (by @cognifloyd)
* st2chatops change: If `st2chatops.env.ST2_API_KEY` is defined, do not set `ST2_AUTH_USERNAME` or `ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD` env vars any more. (#197) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add image.tag overrides for all deployments. (#200) (by @cognifloyd)
* If your k8s cluster admin requires custom annotations (eg: to indicate mongo or rabbitmq usage), you can now add those to each set of pods. (#195) (by @cognifloyd)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Move secrets.st2.* values into st2.* (#203) (by @cognifloyd)
* Auto-generate password and ssh_key secrets. (#203) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add optional hubot-scripts volume to st2chatops pod. To add this, define `st2chatops.hubotScriptsVolume`. (#207) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add advanced pod placment (nodeSelector, affinity, tolerations) to specs for batch Jobs pods. (#193) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow adding dnsPolicy and/or dnsConfig to all pods. (#201) (by @cognifloyd)
* Move st2-config-vol volume definition and list of st2-config-vol volumeMounts to helpers to reduce duplication (#198) (by @cognifloyd)
* Fix permissions for /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa using the postStart lifecycle hook (#219) (by @cognifloyd)
* Make system_user configurable when using custom st2actionrunner images that do not provide stanley (#220) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow providing scripts in values for use in lifecycle postStart hooks of all deployments. (#206) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add preRegisterContentCommand in an initContainer for register-content job to run last-minute content customizations (#213) (by @cognifloyd)
* Fix a bug when datastore cryto keys are not able to read by the rules engine. ``datastore_crypto_key`` volume is now mounted on the ``st2rulesengine`` pods (#223) (by @moti1992)
* Minimize required sensor config by using default values from st2sensorcontainer for each sensor in st2.packs.sensors (#221) (by @cognifloyd)
* Do not template rabbitmq secrets file unless rabbitmq subchart is enabled. (#242) (by @cognifloyd)
* Automatically stringify st2chatop.env values if needed. (#241) (by @cognifloyd)
