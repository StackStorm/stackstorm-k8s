# Changelog

## In Development
* Explicitly differentiate sensor modes: `all-sensors-in-one-pod` vs `one-sensor-per-pod`. Exposes the mode in new `stackstorm/sensor-mode` annotation. (#222) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow adding custom env variables to any Deployment or Job. (#120) (by @AngryDeveloper)
* Template the contents of st2.config and the values in st2chatops.env. This allows adding secrets defined elsewhere in values. (#249) (by @cognifloyd)
* Set default/sample RBAC config files to "" (empty string) to prevent adding them. This is needed because they cannot be removed by overriding the roles/mappings values. (#247) (by @cognifloyd)
* Make configuring `stackstorm/sensor-mode=all-sensors-in-one-pod` more obvious by using `st2.packs.sensors` only for `one-sensor-per-pod`. `all-sensors-in-one-pod` mode now only uses values from `st2sensorcontainer`. (#246) (by @cognifloyd)
* Use "--convert" when loading keys into datastore (in key-load Job) so that `st2.keyvalue[].value` can be any basic JSON data type. (#253) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature: Add `extra_volumes` to `st2actionrunner`, `st2client`, `st2sensorcontainer`. This is useful for loading volumes to be used by actions or sensors. This might include secrets (like ssl certificates) and configuration (like system-wide ansible.cfg). (#254) (by @cognifloyd)
* Some `helm upgrades` do not need to run all the jobs. An upgrade that only touches RBAC config, for example, does not need to run the register-content job. Use `--set 'jobs.skip={apikey_load,key_load,register_content}'` to skip the other jobs. (#255) (by @cognifloyd)
* Refactor deployments/jobs to inject st2 username/password via `envFrom` instead of via `env`. (#257) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature: Add `envFromSecrets` to `st2actionrunner`, `st2client`, `st2sensorcontainer`, and jobs. This is useful for adding custom secrets to the environment. This complements the `extra_volumes` feature (loading secrets as files) to facilitate loading secrets that are not easily injected via the filesystem. (#259) (by @cognifloyd)
* New feature to include `nodeSelector`, `affinity` and `tolerations` to `st2client`, allowing more flexibility to pod positioning. (#263) (by @sandesvitor)
* Template `~/.st2/config`. This allows customizing the settings used by the `st2client` and jobs pods for using the st2 apis. (#262) (by @cognifloyd)

## v0.70.0
* New feature: Shared packs volumes `st2.packs.volumes`. Allow using cluster-specific persistent volumes to store packs, virtualenvs, and (optionally) configs. This enables using `st2 pack install`. It even works with `st2packs` images in `st2.packs.images`. (#199) (by @cognifloyd)
* Updated redis constant sentinel ID which will allow other sentinel peers to update to the new given IP in case of pod failure or worker node reboots. (#191) (by @manisha-tanwar)
* Removed reference to st2-license pullSecrets, which was missed when removing enterprise flags (#192) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add optional imagePullSecrets to ServiceAccount using `serviceAccount.pullSecret` from values.yaml. If pods do not have imagePullSecrets (eg without `image.pullSecret` in values.yaml), k8s populates them from the ServiceAccount. (#196 & #239) (by @cognifloyd)
* Reformat some yaml strings so that single quotes wrap strings that include double quotes (#194) (by @cognifloyd)
* st2chatops change: If `st2chatops.env.ST2_API_KEY` is defined, do not set `ST2_AUTH_USERNAME` or `ST2_AUTH_PASSWORD` env vars any more. (#197) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add image.tag overrides for all deployments. (#200) (by @cognifloyd)
* If your k8s cluster admin requires custom annotations (eg: to indicate mongo or rabbitmq usage), you can now add those to each set of pods. (#195) (by @cognifloyd)
* BREAKING CHANGE: Move secrets.st2.* values into st2.* (#203) (by @cognifloyd)
* Auto-generate password and ssh_key secrets. (#203) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add optional hubot-scripts volume to st2chatops pod. To add this, define `st2chatops.hubotScriptsVolume`. (#207) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add advanced pod placment (nodeSelector, affinity, tolerations) to specs for batch Jobs pods. (#193) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow adding dnsPolicy and/or dnsConfig to all pods. (#201) (by @cognifloyd)
* Move st2-config-vol volume definition and list of st2-config-vol volumeMounts to helpers to reduce duplication (#198) (by @cognifloyd)
* Fix permissions for /home/stanley/.ssh/stanley_rsa using the postStart lifecycle hook (#219) (by @cognifloyd)
* Make system_user configurable when using custom st2actionrunner images that do not provide stanley (#220) (by @cognifloyd)
* Allow providing scripts in values for use in lifecycle postStart hooks of all deployments. (#206) (by @cognifloyd)
* Add preRegisterContentCommand in an initContainer for register-content job to run last-minute content customizations (#213) (by @cognifloyd)
* Fix a bug when datastore cryto keys are not able to read by the rules engine. ``datastore_crypto_key`` volume is now mounted on the ``st2rulesengine`` pods (#223) (by @moti1992)
* Minimize required sensor config by using default values from st2sensorcontainer for each sensor in st2.packs.sensors (#221) (by @cognifloyd)
* Do not template rabbitmq secrets file unless rabbitmq subchart is enabled. (#242) (by @cognifloyd)
* Automatically stringify st2chatop.env values if needed. (#241) (by @cognifloyd)
